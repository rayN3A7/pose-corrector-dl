# Personalized Workout Pose Corrector

A beginner deep learning project using MediaPipe and TensorFlow to detect and correct yoga/exercise poses in real-time. Built as my first DL portfolio piece!

## Overview
- **Goal**: Classify poses as "correct" or "incorrect" from keypoints, with personalization for body type.
- **Tech**: TensorFlow/Keras, MediaPipe, OpenCV.
- **Dataset**: Yoga Pose Classification (Kaggle).
- **Progress**: Day 1 complete—env setup!

## Setup
1. `conda create -n pose_corrector python=3.10`
2. `pip install tensorflow mediapipe ...`
3. `conda install git -c conda-forge` (for Windows users)
4. `git clone https://github.com/rayN3A7/pose-corrector-dl.git`

## Usage
Run notebooks in order: day1_setup.ipynb → day2_data.ipynb → ...

## Results
- Accuracy: [TBD after training]
- Demo: [Link to Streamlit app, post-Day 14]
